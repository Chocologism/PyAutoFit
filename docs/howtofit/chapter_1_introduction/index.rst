Chapter 1: Introduction
=======================

In chapter 1, we introduce you to the **PyAutoFit** and describe how to set up your own model, fit it to data via
a non-linear search and inspect and interpret the results.

The chapter contains the following tutorials:

`Tutorial 1: Model Mapping <https://gesis.mybinder.org/binder/v2/gh/Jammy2211/autofit_workspace/eeef937d5e2fa5e427b77c735a716c0d09f99f62>`_
- The **PyAutoFit** backend that handles model composition.

`Tutorial 2: Model Fitting <https://gesis.mybinder.org/binder/v2/gh/Jammy2211/autofit_workspace/eeef937d5e2fa5e427b77c735a716c0d09f99f62>`_
- Fitting a model with an input set of parameters to data.

`Tutorial 3: Non Linear Search <https://pyautofit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/howtofit/chapter_1_introduction/tutorial_3_non_linear_search.html>`_
- Finding the model parameters that best-fit the data.

`Tutorial 4: Visualization <https://pyautofit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/howtofit/chapter_1_introduction/tutorial_4_visualization.html>`_

`Tutorial 8: Fitting Multiple Datasets <https://pyautofit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/howtofit/chapter_1_introduction/tutorial_8_fitting_multiple_datasets.html>`_
- Fitting a model to multiple similar datasets.

`Tutorial 9: Aggregator <https://pyautofit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/howtofit/chapter_1_introduction/tutorial_9_aggregator.html>`_
- Loading large libraries of results using in-built database tools.

`Tutorial 10: Filtering <https://pyautofit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/howtofit/chapter_1_introduction/tutorial_10_filtering.html>`_
- Filtering the loaded results to find specific results of interest.

`Tutorial 11: Data and Models <https://pyautofit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/howtofit/chapter_1_introduction/tutorial_11_data_and_models.html>`_
- Replotting the model, data and fits of a set of results.
