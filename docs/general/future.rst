Future
======

The following features are planned for 2020 - 2021:

- **Bayesian Model Comparison** - Determine the median PDF model via the Bayesian log evidence.
- **Generalized Linear Models** - Fit for global trends to model fits to large data-sets.
- **Hierarchical modeling** - Combine fits over multiple data-sets to perform hierarchical inference.
- **Time series modelling** - Fit temporally varying models using fits which marginalize over time.
- **Approximate Bayesian Computation** - Likelihood-free modeling.
- **Transdimensional Sampling** - Sample non-linear parameter spaces with variable numbers of model components and parameters.
