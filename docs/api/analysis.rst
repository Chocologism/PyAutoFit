The ``Analysis`` object is used to define the ``log_likelihood_function`` of your model-fitting problem, and acts
as an interface between the data and the non-linear search.

In addition to the API documentation below, checkout the ``overview`` scripts on the ``autofit_workspace`` for a
tutorial in creating an ``Analysis`` for a model-fit:
