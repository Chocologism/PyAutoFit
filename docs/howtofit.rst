HowToFit Lectures
------------------

To build a **PyAutoFit** project, the best starting point is the **HowToFit** lecture series on the
`autofit workspace <https://github.com/Jammy2211/autofit_workspace>`_.

The lectures are provided as Jupyter notebooks - checkout
`this link <https://github.com/Jammy2211/autofit_workspace/blob/master/howtofit/chapter_1_introduction/tutorial_1_model_mapping/tutorial_1_model_mapping.ipynb>`_
for an example of the first notebook.

The lectures consists of 1 chapter:

- **Introduction** - How to perform non-linear model-fitting with **PyAutoFit** and write a *phase* module to exploit
                     **PyAutoFits**'s advanced modeling features.
